# Machine-Learning
	Various other machine learning projects and scripts
	Breast Cancer Classifiers contains various approaches to classifying sklearn's built in Breast Cancer dataset. Clusters/classes of outcomes include malignant or benign.
	Airfoil Calculations uses the airfoil_self_noise.dat file from UCI's machine learning databases. Simply tests for when to use regressor (linear regression) models versus when to use classifiers (random forests). Data is available here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00291/. Data columns are as follows: 0) frequency (in Hertz), 1) angle of attack (in degrees), 2) chord length (in m), 3) free-strem veolicty (in m/s), 4) suction side displacement thickness (in m), and 5) sound pressure (scaled, in db).
